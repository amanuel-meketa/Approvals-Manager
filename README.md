# Approvals Manager

**Approvals Manager** is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate multi-step approval processes for forms and proposals within an organization. The application features configurable steps (such as "Title Submission", "Proposal Submission", and "Final Submission"), allowing administrators to assign specific users to each step, track the status of each submission (Submitted, Pending, Approved, Declined), and ensure transparency and accountability throughout the approval lifecycle. The intuitive dashboard and real-time updates make it easy for users to manage, review, and approve requests efficiently.
